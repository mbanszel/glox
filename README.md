# glox
Crafting Interpreter's lox written in golang.

See [Crafting Interpreters](https://craftinginterpreters.com/).

# TODO
- [ ] Write the glox interpreter
- [ ] Write the glox transpiler to C (the third part of the book)
- [ ] Write a formatter tool (that parses the language and from the AST it generates back the source
      code but nicely formatted, like `black` or `go fmt` do)
